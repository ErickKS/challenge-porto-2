## üìö Project

<p>Academic project developed to solve a problem proposed by the Porto company</p>
<p>The main objective of this project is to create a digital solution that automates the process of bicycle insurance contracting. To achieve this goal, an Artificial Intelligence model has been designed to validate the user's bicycle through real-time photos. The entire image validation process is completed within 1 to 3 seconds, depending on the internet connection speed.</p>
<p>A process that used to take days to complete, due to the need for human intervention in the bicycle inspection, can now be done in less than 5 minutes!</p>
